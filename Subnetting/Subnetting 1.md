# What is an IP Address

# Overview
An IP address is a **unique numerical label** assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves as an address for devices to communicate with each other on the network and enables internet connectivity. It's just a number separated with **3 dots** such as `192.168.1.204`

### Key Concepts
- Everything in your home that connects to the internet, like your phone, laptop, smart tv, etc. has an IP address.

- **Default Gateway:** This is typically your router, which acts as the bridge between your local network (your home network) and the internet (like google or youtube).

- **Broadcast Address:** The last IP address in a subnet, used to send data to all devices within that subnet.

- In a subnet, certain IPs are **reserved**: **the first (network address)**, **the last (broadcast address)**, and the **one assigned to the default gateway**. The **remaining IPs** are available for devices.
