## What is Cloud
Is the delivery of computing services like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, over the internet.

#### Benefits of the Cloud:
- **No need to own hardware:** You ***rent*** what you need.
- **Scalability:**  You can increase/decrease resources as needed.
- **Pay-as-you-go:** You only pay for what you use.
- **Access anywhere:** Just need internet and credentials.

#### Types of Cloud:
##### 1. Public Cloud (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
- Shared infrastructure.
- Most cost-effective and scalable.

##### 2. Private Cloud
- Dedicated infrastructure (either on-site or hosted).
- More control, security, and compliance.

##### 3. Hybrid Cloud
- Mix of **public** + **private** (on-premises infrastructure) environments.

#### On-Premises vs Cloud (Public Cloud)
- **On-Premises:** Provides control over infrastructure but comes with high upfront ***costs*** and ***limited scalability***.
- **Cloud:** Offers ***scalability*** and advanced features ***but may pose security*** and compliance challenges for certain applications.

> **note!:** Hybrid cloud became important because businesses want the best of both worlds, and lets them do both, keeping critical data in-house while offloading other tasks to the public cloud.

#### Challenges of Hybrid Cloud
While hybrid cloud sounds perfect, it brings a few major problems:
- **Management Complexity:** It’s hard to monitor and manage both cloud and on-prem systems together.
- **Skill Gaps:** IT teams often know on-premises tools but aren’t trained in cloud technologies like AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, etc.
- **Integration Problems:** Making on-prem and cloud systems work together can be tricky, and can lead to Latency, data transfer issues, and compatibility concerns.
- **Security Risks:** Because of more complexity, this can lead to more chances for mistakes.

#### How Dell & VMware Solve Hybrid Cloud Problems
Dell Technologies and VMware offer solutions that aim to simplify hybrid cloud management and make it feel like a single, unified environment.
#####  1. VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF)
A platform that lets you run a private cloud using VMware tools on your **own servers (on-prem)** and in **public clouds (like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)**.

#####  2. VMware Tanzu
A platform for **managing Kubernetes and building cloud-native** apps (modern apps designed to run in the cloud).

##### 3. Dell Technologies Cloud
Dell bundles **VMware Cloud Foundation with their own hardware and infrastructure** (like **Dell VxRail**) to give you a **ready-made hybrid cloud** solution.
