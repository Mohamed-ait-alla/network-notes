# CCNA Notes – Network Basics & Subnetting
## OverView
This repository contains my personal notes from [NetworkChuck's CCNA course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7MNX_UD7vY&list=PLIhvC56v63IJVXv0GJcl9vO5Z6znCVb1P) and other resources.
It is organized into two main sections:

**1. Network Basics** – fundamental networking concepts, protocols, and theory.

**2. Subnetting** – subnetting theory with practical examples and exercises.

> The notes are designed for quick review and hands-on learning.
